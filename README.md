How to run it
mvn package && java -jar target/superheroes-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Missing things
- When creating a new SuperHero the api should return the URI of the created superhero
- Add unit tests (I dedicated more time to the structure and i ran out of time so no unit tests were done, i prefered to write some integration tests because the cover all the use cases required by the exercise)
